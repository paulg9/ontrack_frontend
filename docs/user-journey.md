# User Journey (Draft)

1. **Daily check-in prompt** – Anna opens OnTrack in the morning and is greeted with the check-in form. She slides her strain to 3, pain to 2, and notes “tight hamstring but manageable.”
2. **Today’s plan** – After submitting, the app routes her to Today’s Plan where three exercises appear with reps/sets. She taps into “Single-leg bridge” to rewatch the demo video before starting.
3. **Exercise completion** – As Anna finishes each movement, she checks the “Done” box. Completion percentage rises in real time.
4. **Progress glance** – Later she visits the Progress dashboard to see her 5-day streak badge and the 7-day trend list. She generates a share link to send to her trainer.
5. **Reminders hub** – Before leaving, she scans the Reminders page where the system logged a motivational nudge from the previous evening.

Future work will extend the journey to cover plan editing and AI proposal approvals from an admin role.
